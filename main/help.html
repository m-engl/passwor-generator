  <h1>The ULTIMATE (PASS)WORD Generator</h1>
    <p>In order to generate your new (pass)word, begin by choosing the generator module, each of them described below:
      random password, sequence-based password or word-based password.
      <br/>When you are ready, click “Generate”.
      <br/>If you do not like the first password that is generated, you can keep clicking on “Generate” to see other possibilities.
      <br/>Click “Copy” in order to copy your new password to clipboard.</p>

      <h2>RANDOM PASSWORD</h2>

    <p>This module allows you to generate a random password with completely random characters.
    <br/>Begin by entering the desired length of your password, either
      directly from your keyboard or by using the + and - button. Then, choose how strong your password should be.
    <br/>Levels of strength:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weak – uses lower case letters and numbers,</li>
      <li>Medium – uses both lower and upper case letters and numbers,</li>
      <li>Strong – uses both lower and upper case letters, numbers and one special character,</li>
      <li>Super strong - uses both lower and upper case letters, numbers and special characters.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>SEQUENCE-BASED PASSWORD</h2>

    <p>Using the sequence-based password module, you can enter a sequence of words, for example a phrase that you like, and let the program modify it according to the options that you choose.
    <br/>Begin by entering the word sequence, separating the words with spaces.
    <br/><br/>Then, choose what you want the program to do with it.
    <br>Check one, two or all of these options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Numbers – enters random numbers in between the words,</li>
      <li>Special characters– enters random special characters in between the words,</li>
      <li>Mixed case – “mixes” the case so that the words consist of both upper and lower case letters.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>WORD-BASED PASSWORD</h2>

    <p>This module converts the word that you enter in various, customizable ways.
    <br/>Begin by entering the word that you want to work with.
    <br/>
    <br/>Then, choose one of the options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mix case randomly – the word is going to consist of both upper and lower case letters.</li>
      <li>Change all the letters to <em>look-alike</em> numbers and special characters – converts all the letters in your word to special
        characters and numbers, or sets thereof.
        Your word is going to look quite mysterious.
        <br/><b>Warning:</b> This is option alone is not recommended for password use only since you are going to need “regular” characters in your password as well.</li>
      <li>Mix case and change a chosen number of letters to special characters and/or numbers – “mixes” the letters in your word so that it is spelled with both upper and lower case letters. Also, you get to choose how many of the word’s characters you want to have changed to special characters or sets thereof.</li>
      <li>Add a chosen number of special characters and/or numbers in between the word's letters – here, you get to choose how many special characters you want to have added to your word. None of the original characters of the word are changed. Also, you can one, two or all of these options: numbers, special characters and mix case.</li>
    </ul>
